# Instructions

This is a standard npm project, so once it is cloned, just run `npm i` and `npm start` to run it locally.

If you would prefer to view deployed project, it is deployed and hosted using Github Actions and Github Pages. The URL is [here](https://tkdaj.github.io/banjo-demo/)

If you want some demo data in the table to start with, go to: src/api/orders/orders.repository.ts and change `prefillTable` on line 17 to true
